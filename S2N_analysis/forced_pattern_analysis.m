%% Truncated Forced Analysis Analysis
%     [TK,FPS,FINGERPRINTS,S,PVAR,PCS,EOF,N,PVAR_FPS,S_EOFS] = forced_component_analysis(X,XE,TRUNCATION,SCALE,COVTOT)
%     performs forced pattern analysis / signal-to-noise maximizing EOF analysis (see Wills et al. 2020) 
%     on the data in matrix X based on a the ratio of ensemble-mean variance
%     to total variance (Xe gives the mean over ensemble members, which are concatenated in time).

%% INPUT
%     X is a 2D data matrix with time variantions along the first dimension
%     and spatial variations along the second dimension. Ensemble members
%     are concatenated in time.
%
%     XE is a 2D ensemble-mean data matrix with time variantions along the 
%     first dimension and spatial variations along the second dimension
%
%     TRUNCATION is the number of principal components / EOFs to include in
%     the analysis, or (if less than 1) the fraction of variance to retain
%
%     SCALE (optional) a scale vector, which for geospatial data should be 
%     equal to the square root of grid cell area. The default value is one  
%     for all grid points.
%
%     COVTOT (optional) the covariance matrix associated with the data in
%     X. If not specified, COVTOT will be computed from X.

%% OUTPUT

%     FINGERPRINTS is a matrix containing the canonical weight vectors as
%     columns. FPs is a matrix containing the dual vectors of the
%     canonical weight vectors as rows. These are the so-called forced 
%     patterns (FPs). S is a vector measuring the ratio of ensemble-mean
%     signal to total variance for each forced pattern
%
%     PVAR is the percentage of total sample variation accounted for
%     by each of the EOFs. PCS is a matrix containing the principal
%     component time series as columns. EOF is a matrix containing the
%     EOFs, the principal component patterns, as rows. The scalar N
%     is the rank at which the PCA was truncated.
%
%     S is a vector containing the ratio of ensemble-mean signal to total
%     variance for each forced pattern
%
%     PVAR_FPS is a vector of the variance associated with 
%     each forced pattern as a fraction of the total variance. Note that
%     the FPs are not orthogonal, so these values need not add to the
%     total variance in the first N principal components.
%
%     S_EOFS and PVAR are equivalent to S and PVAR_FPS respectively, but 
%     for the original EOFs.
