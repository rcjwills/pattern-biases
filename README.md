# Pattern Biases

Code and preprocessed data for the analysis in Wills et al. (2022, Geophysical Research Letters). Code in the home directory generates the main text figures. Subdirectories include needed functions and pre-processing scripts. 

Note that these scripts rely heavily on loading pre-processed data, which can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6998934. See the preprocessing folder to get see how the processed data was generated from a climate model data archive (with one file per ensemble member).
