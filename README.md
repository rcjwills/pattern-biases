# Pattern Biases

All code used for Wills et al. (2022, submitted to Geophysical Research Letters). Code in the home directory generates the main text figures. Subdirectories include needed functions and pre-processing scripts. 

Note that these scripts rely heavily on loading pre-processed data. See the preprocessing folder to get started in processing data from climate model data archive (with one file per ensemble member) or reach out at rcwills@uw.edu for the preprocessed files generated for the paper.
